### 1. Parametric Test
**Example:** t-test  
**Description:** Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.  
**Real-Life Example:** Comparing the average test scores of two different teaching methods to determine which one is more effective.

### 2. Non-Parametric Test
**Example:** Mann-Whitney U Test  
**Description:** Used to determine if there are differences between two independent groups on a continuous or ordinal dependent variable.  
**Real-Life Example:** Comparing the customer satisfaction ratings (on a scale of 1-10) between two different stores.

### 3. Chi-Square Test
**Example:** Chi-Square Test of Independence  
**Description:** Tests whether two categorical variables are independent of each other.  
**Real-Life Example:** Examining the relationship between gender (male/female) and voting preference (candidate A/candidate B).

### 4. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
**Example:** One-Way ANOVA  
**Description:** Used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.  
**Real-Life Example:** Comparing the mean cholesterol levels among three different diet groups to see if diet type affects cholesterol levels.

### 5. Regression Test
**Example:** Linear Regression  
**Description:** Used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
**Real-Life Example:** Predicting a person's weight based on their height and age.

---

### 6. Correlation Test
**Example:** Pearson Correlation Coefficient  
**Description:** Measures the strength and direction of the association between two continuous variables.  
**Real-Life Example:** Investigating the relationship between the number of hours studied and the score on a final exam.

### 7. Survival Analysis
**Example:** Kaplan-Meier Estimator  
**Description:** Used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data.  
**Real-Life Example:** Estimating the time until recurrence of a disease after treatment in a medical study.
