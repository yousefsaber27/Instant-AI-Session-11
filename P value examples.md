### Example 1: Drug Effectiveness
Imagine a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug intended to lower blood pressure. They gather a sample of 50 patients and measure their blood pressure before and after taking the drug. To determine if the drug has a significant effect, they calculate the p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.05, it suggests the drug significantly lowers blood pressure.

### Example 2: Marketing Campaign Success
A company launches a new marketing campaign and wants to know if it increased sales. They compare the sales figures from the month before and the month after the campaign. By calculating the p-value, they can determine if the increase in sales is statistically significant. A p-value less than 0.05 would indicate the campaign likely had a positive impact on sales.

### Example 3: Education Intervention
A school implements a new teaching method to improve student test scores. They compare the test scores of students before and after the new method is applied. By calculating the p-value, they assess whether the improvement in scores is significant. If the p-value is less than 0.05, it suggests the new teaching method is effective.

### Example 4: A/B Testing in Web Development
A web developer wants to know if a new website design increases user engagement. They conduct an A/B test where half the users see the old design and the other half see the new design. By calculating the p-value, they determine if the difference in engagement between the two designs is statistically significant. A p-value less than 0.05 would suggest the new design is more engaging.
